# bloggo
Cute little blog app to practice with Typescript/Node.js frameworks

To deploy, make sure you have docker-engine and docker-compose installed, and run

`docker-compose up --build`

After deploying once, the app can be put up later with just

`docker-compose up`

By default, the app can be accessed in your web browser at

`http://localhost:8080/`
